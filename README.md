### Cat-egory Collector

Create a javascript application that connects to http://aws.random.cat to pull random cat images. 

- The page should show a random cat image on load
- There should be a button to fetch a new image
- There should be an input to label the image with a category, and a save button next to it
- There should be a list of all the categories saved so far
- If you click on a category, it should show a list of the all the cats saved in that category
- If you reload the page, or navigate back to the page, the previously saved cats and categories should still exist

### Stack
- Use a javascript Single Page Application (SPA) framework: e.g. React, Vue, Angular, Ember, etc.
- Use bootstrap (and your own styles css)
- no backend other than the cat api. Site should be static, only clientside javascript

### Deliverables
- full application code
- image of the project
- a link to the deployed project (github pages is a nice free option)

### Mock up
![wireframe](cat-egory.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
